| **HAM EXAMS** | Dakahuna | 1200 | 1700 |
| **MetaCTF** | MetaCTF Team | 1000 | 1900 |
| **Cloud Breaker: A tale of cyber security, Big Data, and reaching the end of the cloud.** <br> --Find out what happens when your data is bigger than the cloud. In this presentation, hear about the lessons learned when a major financial institution decided to build a massive data lake to support cyber analytics. | Eric Lippart  | 0900 | 1000 |
| **Comparing Malicious Files**<br/> --A critical step one must take during the malware analysis process is to attempt to determine the malware family a sample may belong to. Even if one cannot link a file to a family, one must at least try to find files that are similar and extrapolate information about the sample from comparison with these similar files. This talk reviews a variety of methods for comparing files from simple to complex | Robert Simmons | 1000 | 1100 |
| **Aggressive Autonomous Actions - Operating with Automation** <br/> --This talk is designed to show how automation can help on a red team assessment in multiple methods. For example, it can help automate the boring tasks you don't want to do, it can help protect the assessment's OPSEC by preventing operators from running commands likely to be detected, it can also help with the reporting phase of every assessment. There's a way to automate tasks at every point of an assessment, and the presentation includes the code that will ideally allow attendees to leverage automation. I have an outline if you would like to see that too, just shoot me an e-mail and I can provide it. | Christopher Truncer | 1100 | 1200 |
| **Lunch** | NOVA | 1200 | 1300 |
| **Testing With Proxmox** <br/> --Proxmox is a free virtualization platform similar to VMWare ESX that is based on opensource debian, LXC and KVM with a killer UI. Proxmox is well engineered, with built-in firewall, high availability, and also plenty of command-line options. The talk is geared towards pentesters who want to setup their own pentest environment on low end hardware, securely. | Fred M | 1300 | 1330 |
| **APT32 and Beyond: How to Detect the New Breed of Nation State Attackers** <br/> --Stripping down a new attacker behavior & all of the different things to focus on Assessing novelty/uniqueness, Assessing impact / attack surface, Watching attacker tradecraft through the lens of a technique. Main areas broken into: core detection, observed in-the-wild evasion, challenging your assumptions (going full purple). Then go through a bunch of recent example samples: scriptlets, stylesheets, DeepLink, Outlook homepage, embedded decoys, CLSID hijacks, renamed binaries | Nick Carr | 1330 | 1400|
| **SNACK** | NOVA | 1400 | 1430 |
| **How to People: When the Tech Works But Communication is Broken** <br/> --Everyday, new cyber attacks are crafted and new defenses are deployed. Infosec professionals are continuously learning new tools and techniques in order to keep up with the constantly evolving threat landscape and to work together to secure our future. Often times though, people focus on improving their technical skills but forget about the other key aspects of cybersecurity: teamwork and communication. | Mariah | 1430 | 1500 |
| **Don't Bring Me Down: Botnets Arise** <br/> --Botnets have moved beyond the realm of script kiddies playing the Grinch at Christmas with Playstations & X Boxes. We need to look at these as more than an attack of annoyance or inconvenience. They become one more weapon in a digital arsenal for the games nation states play, no referee, no playbook. | Cheryl | 1500 | 1600 |
| **Be Smart about Bringing Home IoT** <br/> --Have you been interested in building a smart home but don't know where to start? In this talk we will talk about how as part of a home renovation project, we transformed a house to be a smart home. While considering the needs and wants of others living in the home, Joshua will present how he added voice controls, robot skills, wall based controllers, cameras, smart locks, thermostats, in-wall dimmer light switches and fan controllers, speakers, and wiring with battery backup to create a smart home without breaking the bank or compromising the security of his home. <br> The hope is that at the end of this talk, you will be able to pick the features that are right for you and be able to join the smart home revolution too. Also critiques and criticism from those who have started on this journey as well are welcome to help direct this project and provide insight for others who choose to come and learn. | Josh | 1600 | 1700 |
| **Dinner** | NOVA | 1700 | 1800 |
| **How to Solve Cybersecurity: New Paradigms for a New Era** <br/> --Over the next few years, we should expect to see attackers refine and mature their capability to drive outcomes that result in the *inability* for us to recover from an attack, i.e., irreversible attacks. We already are seeing evidence of this now through ransomware (irreversible attack on the availability of data), wikileaks (irreversible attack on the confidentiality of data), #fakenews (irreversible attack on the integrity of data). To proactively address this trend, we need to be in a position to make such attacks irrelevant by being able to conduct irreversible attacks against ourselves (e.g., Chaosmonkey) and design systems so that we can continue our business functions unimpeded. This session articulates the compelling need for us to consider new, business-aligned design patterns that enable us to have systems that are fully resilient against destructive/irreversible attacks and why we need to seriously consider pivoting to this approach to survive. I'll also discuss the implications for our industry and our profession. I will also reveal a new set of concrete measurements and metrics that enable us to focus on true solutions and not just an never-ending list of vulnerability and patching metrics. | Sounil | 1800 | 1830 
| **Empire Mice: Empire stagers via mousejacking** <br/> --MouseJacking is not a new technique, but it is still widely exploitable and a very useful technique to get your initial foothold in a network. In this presentation I plan to briefly talk about what mousejacking is and show how we can use it to inject a Empire stager to gain a foothold in our target network and begin pivoting. | Skylar Simmons | 1830 | 1900 |
| **Watch All the Things** <br/> --The Endpoint Monitoring Team at Capital One deploys and manages one of the largest open source/freeware security solutions in the world. Combining the power of OSQuery, Sysmon, Windows Eventlogs, and NXLog, we are able to monitor tens of thousands of endpoints on-premise and in the cloud. The team develops and maintains simple pipelines to minimize the amount of overhead and cost while at the same time ensuring zero data lost from the endpoint to the SIEM. Our talk will discuss the critical infrastructure decisions we made, streaming vs batch data processing, as well as any custom integrations we developed to make the pipeline more robust. | Timothy Desrochers | 1900 | 2000 |
| **Cloudy with a Chance of Cloud** <br/> --With the ubiquity of cloud services for every layer of your stack, it is important to understand the innumerable combination of service offerings and the tyranny of the default! This talk will focus on the crowd favorite, AWS, and how defaults and/or lazy service hardening leads to a strong forecast of compromise, from internal or external actors! | Alexander Stein | 2000 | 2100 |
| **Closing Remarks** | NOVA | 2100 | 2100 |
